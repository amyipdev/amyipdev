I see you've found my GitHub page. Welcome into a world of code, dreams, and new ideas.

_About Me_: I'm Amy, a college sophomore and high school freshy. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and am aiming to transfer to a four-year shortly. My pronouns are she/her. I'm from California and currently working on a variety of projects.
